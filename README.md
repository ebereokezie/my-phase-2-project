# A Brief NBA history

An application used to learn the history of some of the NBA's historic franchises and upload personal photos, built with ```React```.


# Installation

You will need to install ``` node ``` and ``` npm ``` globally on your machine in order to use ```React```. 

Installation:

``` npm install ```

To Start App:


``` npm start ```


# Usage

This app was created to provide users with a App that centralized NBA history, but was also interactive for users. The user can navigate around the App, selecting their preferred NBA franchise, and learn interesting facts about the history of the varying NBA teams. Fans of different franchises can also use the App to express their fandom, uploading pictures of themselves and/or friends in their NBA gear, representing their favorite NBA franchise or NBA player. 

This project was created using  ```React```. A template was created when installing ```create-react-app```, and a local ```db.json```file was created in order to create a json-server template for backend code. Data was populated based on information found from different NBA resources, such as "sportsteamhistory.com/" and "NBA.com".
